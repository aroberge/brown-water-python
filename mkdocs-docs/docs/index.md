Brown Water Python: Better Docs for the Python `tokenize` Module.
=================================================================

The `tokenize` module in the Python standard library is very powerful,
but its [documentation](LINK) is somewhat limited. In the spirit of the
[Green Tree Snakes](LINK) project, which provides similar extended
documentation for the `ast` module, I am providing here some extended
documentation for effectively working with the `tokenize` module.
