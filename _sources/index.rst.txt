Brown Water Python
==================

Some better docs for the Python ``tokenize`` module.

The ``tokenize`` module in the Python standard library is very powerful, but
its `documentation <LINK>`_ is somewhat limited. In the spirit of the `Green
Tree Snakes <LINK>`_ project, which provides similar extended documentation
for the ``ast`` module, I am providing here some extended documentation for
effectively working with the ``tokenize`` module.
