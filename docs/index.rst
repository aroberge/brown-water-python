 Brown Water Python: Better Docs for the Python ``tokenize`` Module.
=====================================================================

The ``tokenize`` module in the Python standard library is very powerful, but
its `documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/tokenize.html>`_ is
somewhat limited. In the spirit of the `Green Tree Snakes
<https://greentreesnakes.readthedocs.io/>`_ project, which provides similar
extended documentation for the ``ast`` module, I am providing here some
extended documentation for effectively working with the ``tokenize`` module.

.. note::

   This document is currently a work in progress. I plan to add more, but any
   feedback on what I already have or what you'd like to see is welcome. Feel
   free to `open an issue
   <https://github.com/asmeurer/brown-water-python/issues>`_ or pull request
   about anything (questions, comments on what you'd like to see, corrections,
   etc.).
